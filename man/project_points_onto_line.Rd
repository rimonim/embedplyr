\usage{
project_points_onto_line(points, line_start, line_end)
}
\arguments{
\item{points}{a dataframe, matrix, or embeddings object in which each row
represents the coordinates of a point to be projected onto the line}

\item{line_start}{a vector of representing the coordinates of the line's start}

\item{line_end}{a vector representing the coordinates of the line's end}
}
\description{

\details{
\code{project_points_onto_line} calculated the projections of a group of points onto
a line defined by two end points. It is useful for graphing the positions of
embeddings with respect to an anchored vector.
