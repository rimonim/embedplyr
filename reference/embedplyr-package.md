# embedplyr: Tools for Working With Text Embeddings

Common operations with word and text embeddings within a
'tidyverse'/'quanteda' workflow, as demonstrated in "Data Science for
Psychology: Natural Language". Includes simple functions for calculating
common similarity metrics, as well as higher level functions for loading
pretrained word embedding models (e.g. 'GloVe'), applying them to words,
aggregating to produce text embeddings, and reducing dimensionality.
